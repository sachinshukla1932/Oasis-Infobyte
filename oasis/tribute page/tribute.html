			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a theoretical physicist and philosopher widely considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Einstein's contributions to modern physics include the famous equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between mass and energy, and his work on the photoelectric effect, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein was also an outspoken advocate for pacifism, civil rights, and humanitarianism, and his writings on these subjects continue to inspire and influence people around the world.</p>
			<p>Einstein was also a passionate pacifist and civil rights activist, and his work had a profound impact on the development of nuclear energy and weapons.</p>

			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in the city of Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer, and his mother, Pauline Einstein (née Koch), was a homemaker. Einstein had one younger sister, Maja. </p><p></p> As a child, Einstein was interested in mathematics and science, and he began teaching himself algebra and calculus when he was just 12 years old. However, he struggled in school and did not do well in the traditional classroom setting. Einstein's family moved to Italy when he was 15 years old, and he later moved to Switzerland to continue his education. It was there that he enrolled in the Polytechnic School in Zurich and began his studies in physics and mathematics.</p>
			<p>After graduating, Einstein struggled to find work as a teacher or researcher. He eventually landed a job as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, where he spent his free time developing his own theories about the nature of the universe.</p>

			<h2>Contributions</h2>
			<p>Einstein's most famous contribution to science is his theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. He also made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.</p>
			<p>Einstein was a vocal opponent of the use of nuclear weapons, and he played a key role in the development of the atomic bomb. He also worked to promote world peace and civil rights, and he was a founding member of the NAACP.</p>

			<h2>Awards and Honors</h2>
			<p>Einstein received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. He was also offered the presidency of Israel in 1952, but he declined the offer.</p>
			<p>After his death in 1955, Einstein's brain was removed and preserved for scientific study. Researchers have since found that Einstein's brain had several unique features that may have contributed to his exceptional intellect.</p>
